## Description

I created a personal portfolio using React for potential employers to see who I am, view my work, and contact me. I used react components to structure the pages, and multiple forms of styling to exhibit my knowledge of CSS utilization including Bootstap, CSS in JS styling compenents, and .css files. This is a single page application (SPA). Clicking a link in the navigation will render a new React component page. Each component and page has its own specialized CSS stlying to minimize error and enhance production as well as scalabity.
