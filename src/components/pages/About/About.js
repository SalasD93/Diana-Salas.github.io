            <p>I hold an Associate of Science degree in Criminology and Criminal Justice. I obtained my degree in 2014 while studying at Hillsborough Community College in Tampa, FL. I graduated with honors. I am very ambitious, self-taught, self-motivated, and adaptable. I always strive to be the best and I love to learn and grow every chance I can.</p>
            <p>I am a Full Stack Web Developer with a certification from the University of Miami which I obtained through their intensive 24 week online Coding Bootcamp. I chose this career due to my fascination with learning how people work, wanting to know why they do the things they do, and how the brain works. When I realized computers function similarly to the human brain, I knew I could integrate that passion in a more hands-on way. </p>
            <p>My passion for problem solving makes this a great career choice. I genuinely love to debug and enhance code. I get that sense of accomplishment when I have successfully fixed code or made it better.</p>
            <p>I am a very empathetic person who usually understands what people like and need. I like to incorporate that personal characteristic with web development when constructing user-focused, mobile-responsive, and accessible web applications.</p>
